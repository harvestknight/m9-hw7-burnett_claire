ISSUES
-For step 6.b.i. on the homework (changing the background color of Order Now and Find a Location li), the console was recognizing when I moused in and out, but it wouldn't change the background color. I didn't think it made sense to set up a loop like you did in class because there are so many li throughout my code. I tried a variety of different things for the classList line of code, but I couldn't get the background color to respond in the nav. I eventually consulted with a classmate and we walked through it together. I eventually changed everything to a loop for each link, but I am sure there is a more concise way to write it. I tried what you recommended to me in the weekend email, but could also not get that to work. 
-For step 6.b.2., when I put in the locations, it bumped my following buttons to the next line. I had to rearrange my nav to make it stop doing that because I couldn't figure out how to make it respond correctly. When I tried to make them show up with show-div, I could not get the text to show upon click. I moved my IDs from the li to the a, which fixed the issue but then made the hover stop working on desktop - it still works on the mobile menu. 
-My commits suddenly stopped showing up in my GitHub repo. In my terminal, all looks normal, but that don't show up. I tried everything I could think og, from starting completely over to recloning my repo and they just won't show up. 
-I generally felt like this assignment was way over my head, and not for lack of trying. I spent my weekend trying to tackle it and just couldn't seem to get it to work.
